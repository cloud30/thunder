iOS Prototyping for Everyone
============================

Designers can give their best only when they are familiar with the underlying technology they are designing for. Until now, iOS presented a pretty steep learning curve for designers and developers alike.

_Thunder_ is an iOS app for designers and developers that want to get into native iOS without all the complications. If you can create an HTML page, you can use _Thunder_! But what you see in _Thunder_ is the real thing, all UIKit views, view controllers, and their properties -- including crashes when something is screwed up! :)

This repository collects samples and documentation related to _Thunder_.
